            "question": "If you are a creator on “OTT” platforms",
            "answer": "Procrastinating on finishing your dream script for a political satire? Drama series with unfiltered speech? Set for a standup on life as a minority in the country? Or a plain old documentary depicting social and political realities? You might have to reconsider. You might very soon be moral-policed and with your art being filtered, modified and even censored. By bringing the likes of Netflix, Disney+, Jio Cinema under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s regulatory ambit, the government hopes to extend conventional regulation of traditional forms of media to on-demand or curated programmes available over the internet.So gear up to say goodbye to Sacred Games, and welcome to the era of Sanskari Games. You will soon have to vet your work against a code of conduct similar to those applicable to cable TV and modify/ censor content accordingly. The Broadcasting Bill, 2023 imposes stringent punishment for non-compliance with the code of conduct, including temporary suspension, expulsion from membership, advisory, warning, censure, and/or monetary fine of up to 5 lakhs. If you are a creator/ director/ producer/ artist with a stake in the content you create and publish on “OTT” platforms, your artistic freedom and creativity are under attack.

            "question": "If you are an “OTT” platform",
            "answer": "Your subscribers won’t be chilling anytime soon. The Broadcasting Bill, 2023 intends to alter the very functioning of “OTT” platforms, which is the primary reason for their rise in popularity. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/20/india-netflix-amazon-movies-self-censorship/'>Pressure </a> on platforms to take down or modify content <a href='https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/worried-about-obscenity-india-asks-ott-platforms-for-content-checks-123071400415_1.html'>unpalatable </a> to the government is not a new development. Platforms have <a href='https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/otts-tread-on-cautious-ground-axe-shows/amp-11615188592226.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in'>often</a> felt threatened, coerced, and faced backlash for the kind of content they host. However, the Broadcasting Bill, 2023 is a new and daunting development as it works to solidify and institutionalise this culture of self-censorship through stringent compliance obligations and penalties. Furthermore, it empowers the Union government to inspect, intercept, monitor, and seize the equipment of broadcasting networks and services as well as prohibit operation in the “public interest”. These powers may be misused to create a chilling effect and an environment of fear among the platforms. So if you are a platform and wish to host a diverse range of content that would cater to the taste of your subscribers and thus be profitable to you, think again. Hosting or refusing to take action against flagged content (which could be anything from “anti-national” to “obscene”, “derogatory”, or “hurting religious sentiments”) could land you in serious trouble with the Executive. Worried about increased compliance burden, shrinking customer base, or rising monetary costs? Write to MIB using our template response and share your grievance today!"

            "question": "If you are a subscriber of any “OTT” platform",
            "answer": "Wondering what YOU should binge this weekend? So is the government! Say goodbye to the refreshing quality content that OTT bring to your screens. The long list of uncensored content that you get to consume today, at your time and on your device of choosing, will not be so long and uncensored soon. The censorship code applicable to cable TV will soon have to be followed by “OTT” content creators and platforms, to avoid stringent penalties. You may correctly think that broadcasting services like cable TV works on a “push” model wherein the content streamed is up to the distributors and can’t be changed per your will as opposed to “OTT” platforms which work on a “pull” model. In the latter, you have total autonomy over what you wish to watch from a library of content. Such a <a href='https://www.mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/pc1_0.pdf'>code of conduct</a> will seriously limit your browsing choice as it will censor or filter “indecent”, “obscene”, or similar content “unsuitable for public exhibition”. A censored Mirzapur or Game of Thrones is not what you signed up for? Stand up for your freedom to private browsing. Write to MIB using our template response and make yourself heard! "

            "question": "If you are an online news publisher/ broadcaster",
            "answer": "If you are an individual or company (domestic and foreign), publishing news in a commercial or professional capacity, through a digital medium, then your rights and freedoms are most directly and fiercely under attack under the Broadcasting Bill, 2023. The bill extends adherence to a code of conduct which is yet to be prescribed to any person who broadcasts news and current affairs programs through an online paper, news portal, website, social media intermediary, or other similar medium. So the independence of news publications like The Wire, Caravaan, Scroll, Quint, even independent journalists like Ravish Kumar, Faye D’souza, Rana Aayub, may very well hang in the balance. To add to the mess, the MIB has vaguely defined news as “newly received or noteworthy programmes, including analysis, about recent events primarily of socio-political, economic or cultural nature”. Simply put, this provision will affect your online free speech as well as your freedom of journalistic expression. To avoid monetary or other consequences of non-compliance, you might be coerced into only produce content which is palatable to the Union government. If you want to continue reporting on news and current affairs without any fear of censorship or pressure from the Union government, speak up today. Write to MIB using our template response and save the right to free speech."
